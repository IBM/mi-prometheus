        Proceeds to the handshake between what the Model produces as predictions and what the Problem expects to compute\

        .. note::

            Handshaking is defined here as making sure that the ``Model`` and the ``Problem`` agree on the data that they
            exchange.
            More specifically, the ``Problem`` has a definition of the targets data that it expects\
            (through its ``self.data_definitions`` attribute). The ``Model`` has the same object describing what \
            it generates.

            This functions proceeds to the handshaking as:

                - Verifying that the key ``targets`` is present in ``Model.data_definitions`` (representing the logits)\
                and in ``Problem.data_definitions`` (representing the ground truth answers).
                If not, an exception is thrown.

                - If this key exists, than this function checks that the shape and type specified in\
                   ``Model.data_definitions`` are accepted by the loss function specified by the Problem.
                   Similarly, it also checks if the shape & type indicated for ``Problem.data_definitions_``\
                    are accepted by its loss function. If not, an exception is thrown.


            **If both steps above passed, than the Problem accepts what the Model generates as predictions.**


            To properly define the ``data_definitions`` dicts, here are some examples:

                >>> data_definitions = {'img': {'size': [-1, 320, 480, 3], 'type': [np.ndarray]},
                >>>                     'question': {'size': [-1, -1], 'type': [torch.Tensor]},
                >>>                     'question_length': {'size': [-1], 'type': [list, int]},
                >>>                     # ...
                >>>                     }

                Please indicate both the size and the type as ``lists``:

                    - Indicate all dimensions in the correct order for each key `size` field. If a dimension is\
                    unimportant or unknown (e.g. the batch size or variable-length sequences), then please indicate \
                    ``-1`` at the correct location. Also indicate the corect number of dimensions.

                    - both the ground truth targets and the logits should be ``torch.tensor``.

        other definitions).
        :type model_data_definitions_: dict
