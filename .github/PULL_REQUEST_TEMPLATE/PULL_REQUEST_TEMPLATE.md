## Pull Request template
Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not, then make sure that:

     2.1. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches should have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/new-model`.

     2.2. You have descriptive commits messages with short titles (first line).

     2.3. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

     3.1. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

     3.2. Provide a description of your changes.

     3.3. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).

Important: Please review the [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) file for detailed contributing guidelines.
