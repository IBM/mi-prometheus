## Description

MI-Prometheus (Machine Intelligence - Prometheus), an open-source framework aiming at _accelerating Machine Learning Research_, by fostering the rapid development of diverse neural network-based models and facilitating their comparison. 
In its core, to _accelerate the computations_ on their own, MI-Prometheus relies on PyTorch and extensively uses its mechanisms for the distribution of computations on CPUs/GPUs.

In MI-Prometheus, the training & testing mechanisms are no longer pinned to a specific model or problem, and built-in mechanisms for easy configuration management & statistics collection facilitate running experiments combining different models with problems.

A project of the Machine Intelligence team, IBM Research, Almaden.


### Installation

PyTorch is the main library used by MI-Prometheus for tensors computations.
Please refer to the [official installation guide for PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#installation) to install it.
We currently do not officially support PyTorch >= v0.4.1 (especially the v1.0 preview), but intend to in the near future.

To install MI-Prometheus, you can use the `setup.py` script with the following command:

    python setup.py install

We will upload MI-prometheus to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) in the near future.

The dependencies of MI-prometheus are: 

   * pytorch (v. 0.4.0)
   * numpy
   * torchvision
   * torchtext
   * tensorboardx
   * matplotlib 
   * PyYAML
   * tqdm
   * nltk
   * h5py
   * pyqt5 (v. 5.10.1)


## Core ideas

   * **Problem**: A dataset or a data generator, returning a batch of inputs and ground truth labels used for a model training/validation/test,
   * **Model**: A trainable model (i.e. a neural network),
   * **Worker**: A specialized application that instantiates the Problem \& Model objects and controls the interactions between them,
   * **Configuration file(s)**: YAML file(s) containing the parameters of the Problem, Model and training procedure (e.g. terminal conditions, random seeds), divided into several sections,
   * **Experiment**: A single run (training & validation or test) of a given Model on a given Problem, using a specific Worker and Configuration file(s). Such an Experiment also collects and logs diverse statistics during its execution.

## Core features

   * A configuration management relying on (optionally nested) human-readable YAML files,
   * Reusable scripts unifying the training & test procedures, enabling reproducible experiments, 
   * Automated tools for collecting statistics and logging the results of the experiments,
   * A set of scripts for running a number ("grid") of experiments on collections of CPUs/GPUs,
   * A collection of diverse problems, currently covering most of the actively explored domains,
   * A collection of (often state-of-the-art) models,
   * A set of tools to analyze the models during training and test (displaying model statistics and graph, dynamic visualizations, export of data to TensorBoard).
   



### Base workers

The base workers are the main way you will use MI-Prometheus. They are parameterizable, OOP-designed scripts which will execute a specific task related to the supervised training or test of a Model on a Problem, following a Configuration.

   * Offline Trainer - A traditional trainer, epoch-based and well-suited for traditional supervised training.

```console
foo@bar:~$ mip-offline-trainer --h
usage: mip-offline-trainer [-h] [--config CONFIG] [--model MODEL] [--gpu]
                           [--outdir OUTDIR] [--savetag SAVETAG]
                           [--ll {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG,NOTSET}]
                           [--li LOGGING_INTERVAL] [--agree]
                           [--tensorboard {0,1,2}] [--visualize {-1,0,1,2,3}]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --config CONFIG       Name of the configuration file(s) to be loaded. If specifying more than one file, they must be separated with coma ",".
  --model MODEL         Path to the file containing the saved parameters of the model to load (model checkpoint, should end with a .pt extension.)
  --gpu                 The current worker will move the computations on GPU devices, if available in the system. (Default: False)
  --outdir OUTDIR       Path to the output directory where the experiment(s) folders will be stored. (DEFAULT: ./experiments)
  --savetag SAVETAG     Tag for the save directory
  --ll {CRITICAL,ERROR,WARNING,INFO,DEBUG,NOTSET}
                        Log level. (Default: INFO)
  --li LOGGING_INTERVAL
                        Statistics logging interval. Will impact logging to the logger and exporting to TensorBoard. Writing to the csv file is not impacted (interval of 1). (Default: 100, i.e. logs every 100 episodes).
  --agree               Request user confirmation just after loading the settings, before starting training  (Default: False)
  --tensorboard {0,1,2}
                        If present, enable logging to TensorBoard. Available log levels:
                        0: Log the collected statistics.
                        1: Add the histograms of the model's biases & weights (Warning: Slow).
                        2: Add the histograms of the model's biases & weights gradients (Warning: Even slower).
  --visualize {-1,0,1,2,3}
                        Activate dynamic visualization (Warning: will require user interaction):
                        -1: disabled (DEFAULT)
                        0: Only during training episodes.
                        1: During both training and validation episodes.
                        2: Only during validation episodes.
                        3: Only during the last validation, after the training is completed.

```

   * Online Trainer - A different type of trainer, more flexible and well-suited for problems generating samples _on-the-fly_.

### Grid workers

Grid Workers manage several experiments ("_grids_") by reusing the base workers, such as OfflineTrainer \& Tester.
There are 3 types of Grid Workers:

- mip-grid-trainer-*, which span several trainings in parallel. Two versions are available: One for CPU cores (`GridTrainerCPU`) and one for GPUs (CUDA) (`GridTrainerGPU`),
- mip-grid-tester-*, which test several trained models in parallel. The same two versions are available: `GridTesterCPU` & `GridTesterGPU`,
- mip-grid-analyzer, which summarizes the results of several trainings & tests into one csv file.

 * Grid Trainer(s):

```console
foo@bar:~$ mip-grid-trainer-cpu --h

  --n NUM_TESTS         Number of test experiments to run for each model.
```

 * Grid Analyzer: Similar options.

**NOTES**: 
* We primarily test MI-Prometheus on CUDA devices, as they are our main hardware setup and PyTorch mainly supports CUDA as a backend.
* We currently are using a utility called [cuda-gpupick](https://github.com/aasseman/cuda-gpupick) to  pick unused CUDA devices (in a topology-aware fashion) for the GPU versions of the Grid Workers.
While this utility is easily installable and usable, we understand that this is a supplementary constraint, which we will work on to relax it.
